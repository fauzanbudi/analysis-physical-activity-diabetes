Abstract

Diabetes is one of the leading death causes in the world. Indonesia is a country with the highest rates of death caused by diabetes. 
Physical activity is one of the modifiable diabetes risk factors. This study focuses on the understanding association of physical activity in different levels and diabetes after being controlled by confounding variables. 
This study is an analysis of the Indonesian Family Life Survey Tahun 2014 (IFLS 2014). The research methodology in this study is cross-sectional with multivariate analysis. 
After being controlled by the residential area variable, moderate physical activity (OR = 1,62 CI 95% 1,21 - 2,18) and low physical activity (OR = 1,94 CI 95% = 1,47 - 2,56) have a higher risk compared to high physical activity for diabetes. 
Feasible health interventions to be executed are a synergy between all departments and government bodies, the private sector, non-profit, and BPJS Kesehatan (National Health Insurance) for optimization of physical activity programs that are suitable for the urban lifestyle and encouraging adequate infrastructures and facilities for people in the urban areas to be able to do moderate until high physical activity.
